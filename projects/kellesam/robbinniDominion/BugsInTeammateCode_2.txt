Description
===========
After playing the adventurer card the player's hand count and discard counts are both
incorrect. The hand count is 1 card too high and the discard count is 2 cards too low.
It appears that two cards are not properly disposed (either two drawn non-treasure
cards or one drawn non-treasure card and the played adventurer card) and one of them
has an additional issue with incrementing the disposal count.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Call the performAdventurerCardEffect() function with at least 2 treasure cards in the
player's deck. Compare the hand, deck, and discard counts before and after the card
is played.


Expected Results
----------------
The player's hand gains 1 card (2 new treasures, discard 1 played adventurer card).
The player's deck loses 2 treasure and all drawn non-treasure cards.
The player's discard gains 1 adventurer card and all drawn non-treasure cards.


Actual Results
--------------
The player's hand incorrectly gains 2 cards.
The player's deck correctly loses 2 treasure and all drawn non-treasure cards.
The player's discard incorrectly gains 2 cards fewer than expected.


Workarounds
-----------
None.

Logs from unit testing:

TEST 1: player gains 2 cards, discards all other revealed cards
Treasure placed at deck positions 0 and 1
Finding the two treasures will require disposing 3 other cards
before: hand count = 5, expected = 5
before: deck count = 5, expected = 5
Play card
after: hand count = 7, expected = 6
Function did not return <6>
ASSERT FAILED: hand count = 7, expected = 6
after: deck count = 0, expected = 0

Other Information
-----------------
I would suggest checking if one of the drawn cards not being disposed and the 
adventurer card is not calling discardCard().
