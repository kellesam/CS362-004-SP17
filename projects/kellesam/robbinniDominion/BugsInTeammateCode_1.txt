Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
The smithy card calls discardCard() on itself after drawing 3 cards but does not
end up in the player's discard pile. I used tesing assertions to verify that the
player's discard count is 1 less than it should be. This error happens for all
instances of the smithy function, regardless of the player's hand, deck, and
discard counts.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Call the performSmithyCardEffect() function with at least 3 cards in the player's
deck. Make sure the discardCount variable is set to a valid, positive integer.


Expected Results
----------------
The discard count is incremented by 1 after the smithy card is played and discarded.


Actual Results
--------------
The discard count remains unchanged.


Workarounds
-----------
None.

Logs from unit testing:

TEST 5: discard pile gains 1 card
before: discard pile = 0, expected = 0
Play card
after: discard pile = 0, expected = 1
Function did not return <1>
ASSERT FAILED: discard count = 0, expected = 1

RANDOM TESTS.
Function did not return <143>
ASSERT FAILED: discard count = 142, expected = 143
Function did not return <388>
ASSERT FAILED: discard count = 387, expected = 388


Other Information
-----------------
I would suggest checking if the card is either trashed instead of discarded or
if the card is incorrectly discarded into another player's discard pile.
